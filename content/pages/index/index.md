I am a software engineer, turned into a data engineer and then became a machine learning one.

I work for an energy company where I’m helping to build the data engineering function that supports the Data Science team. The goal of the two teams is to try to leverage the data (coming from the company’s plants around the world) in order to build ML models for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, logistic optimisation, energy efficiency, etc.

I’m also a dog lover and I’m passionate about endurance sports. So, playing with my labradors and training is what I do in my free time.

In the picture above I’m the one on the left ;)
