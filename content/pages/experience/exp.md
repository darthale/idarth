I started my career in software engineering as a Web Services and API developer using mainly J2EE as programming language and Spring and Hibernate as frameworks.

I then moved abroad where I started to explore new areas of software engineering, getting closer to the data engineering one. I started to work on projects with a data flavour first and with a data science focus after. My responsibilities went from merely developing API to architecting data intensive applications, making infrastructure decisions, designing BI dashboards and leading the development of multiple projects.

I got closer and closer to the Data Science world, working side by side with Data Scientists to build products with Machine Learning at their core. At the same time I have embraced a DevOps philosophy where everything was built, maintained and owned within our Data Science squad. In this period, mentoring and managing more junior engineers also became an area of focus.

At the moment I’m part of a newly created team within a big player of the Oil and Gas industry. As a Machine Learning engineer, I’m tasked with: building the foundations of our engineering team, architecting new evolutions of our data platform and supporting the Data Science team productionising their models.

My goals for the next years are: being able to tackle Data Science projects in their entirety by myself and lead a team composed of Engineers and Scientists.

### Senior Data Engineer (October 2017 – February 2019)

LiveRamp is a California-based SaaS company that offers an identity resolution platform. Its main product connects people, data and devices across the digital and the physical world, enabling a people based marketing approach.

In my position at LiveRamp I worked as Senior Data Engineer within the Data Science team. The main aim of the team was to build data based products, in the form of APIs or services that other platforms could integrate and leverage.

In my experience here I have:

* Introduced software development best practices: shared repositories, PR, code reviews
* Led the team Agile development
* Created and shaped the role of the data engineer within the team, as first engineer hire
* Designed and contributed to the whole infrastructure
* Helped creating our candidates interview process, through offline technical tests and f2f screening
* Architected the migration from our Hadoop physical cluster to a full cloud solution on GCP
* Built a machine learning serverless API product, based on the AWS stack that included: Docker + ECS for the ML part, API Gateway and Lambda for the API bit, SQS and DynamoDB for async communication and storage, Terraform for the whole infrastructure


## DataXu
### Application Engineer (December 2014 – October 2017)

DataXu is a Boston based provider of programmatic marketing software for brands and agencies.

At DataXu I worked as Software Engineer in the Application Engineering team. The squad main goal was to build custom solutions for tier 1 clients, internal tools and demo products for beta launches.

Here I had to deal with a large mixture of open-source and proprietary technology. Within the team we worked with: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Python, Java and BASH (for programming languages), Qubole, AWS, PostgreSQL, CentOS (for frameworks and OS). In term of day-to-day tasks instead, I dealt with: software architecture design and development, translation of non-technical requirements in technical ones, BI dashboards design and data-pipeline developments.

In my time here I have:

* Extensively worked with Sales and Account Managment teams on projects for UK tier 1 clients
* Worked on a product able to recommend marketing budget allocation for Vodafone UK, leading the design and the development of the software along with a team of Data Scientists
* Worked on different integrations between our platform and the Sky UK one to connect digital channels with TV ones
* Been the first software engineer hire in the UK, establishing way-of-working for the Application Engineering team outside US


## Zodiak Active

### Software Engineer (March 2011 – March 2014)

Zodiak Active is an Italian media agency that plans and serves marketing campaigns across different distribution channels.

During my last year of bachelor studies I started to work at Zodiak, as part of the Quality Assurance team: it was March 2010 and at the time the actual name was Neo Network. After my Bachelor graduation, I continued to work at Zodiak through my Master’s Degree and I got promoted to Software Engineer.

As a Software Engineer, I spent most of my time contributing to different aspects and components of an advertising platform that facilitated advertisers and publishers to run campaigns and monetise their inventory.

In my experience here I have:

* Designed and implemented RESTful API for the communication between back-end and front-end, using J2EE, Spring and Hibernate
* Worked at the integration with third parties API
* Architected and developed a very primitive form of Micro Services and Web Services
* Supported and trained clients to use the platform
* Gained experience both on physical servers and AWS EC2 instances
